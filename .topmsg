Subject: Backports from EGLIBC.

    $ GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES=$PWD/../eglibc/git/.git/objects git cherry-pick -x --strategy=subtree SHA1

The ChangeLog hunk (which failed to apply) goes into ChangeLog.SHA1.

    $ GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES=$PWD/../eglibc/git/.git/objects git commit

After ``tg update'' (and possibly dealing with merge conflicts), manually check
which can be removed, and remove the ChangeLog.SHA1.

If there are no backports, ``git diff baseline'' must only show the .top* files
on t/eglibc_backports.
