Subject: Baseline for our topic branches.

---

This need not strictly be a TopGit branch, but it is for easy synchronization
between different machines.

As the baseline is merged into the topic branches, it is forward-only.

To advance it:

    $ echo [SHA1] > .topdeps
    $ git commit -m Advance. -- .topdeps
    $ tg update
