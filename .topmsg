Subject: [PATCH] Fix f?chflags prototypes, declare them and their flags.

Although they are defined on GNU/Hurd, f?chflags were never declared. It
seems the BSD prototype actually uses an unsigned long, so we can take
the opportunity to fix the prototype, while adding an actual
declaration.

* misc/chflags.c (chflags): Set flags parameter type to unsigned long instead of
int.
* misc/fchflags.c (fchflags): Likewise.
* sysdeps/mach/hurd/chflags.c (chflags): Likewise.
* sysdeps/mach/hurd/fchflags.c (fchflags): Likewise.
* sysdeps/mach/hurd/bits/stat.h (UF_SETTABLE, UF_NODUMP, UF_IMMUTABLE,
UF_APPEND, UF_OPAQUE, UF_NOUNLINK, SF_SETTABLE, SF_ARCHIVED, SF_IMMUTABLE,
SF_APPEND, SF_NOUNLINK, SF_SNAPSHOT): Declare macros.
(chflags, fchflags): Declare functions.
